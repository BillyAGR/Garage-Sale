# The store online: Chic's Garage Sale

- It's a website for simulating garage sales in an easy way.
- This website represents an easy way for junior developers to learn how the different parts of web architecture and methodology work. This page works with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The website is a very intuitive online store with a responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- It has three folders: "styles," "Images," and the "javascript" file.
